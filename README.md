# WOMEN SAFETY APP
If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home, for if a women cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere. A recent article in India claimed that India is the fourth most dangerous place for women's to take public transport and the second worst for safety while travelling at night.
The awful Delhi bus gang rape in 2012 is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the dangers of taking public transport as a woman. This rape incident occurred on 16th December 2012 at a place Munirka, a neighborhood in south Delhi which was a fatal assault. A 23 year old woman a physiotherapist was hit by a gang while she was travelling in a public transport(bus)with a male friend. Another such incident of TCS software engineer took place at Bhandup where the body has been found after two days near Kanjurmarg suburb, this incident was parallel just to the one evoked by Nirbhaya case in Delhi. One more case taken place in Mumbai where woman was travelling to her native place and she got kidnapped and killed.
